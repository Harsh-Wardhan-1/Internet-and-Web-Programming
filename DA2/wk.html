    <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television
        sets all
        over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television
        at a
        local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third
        child.

        'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years.
        The
        party's started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the
        night of the
        final.’


        Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni
        enchanted
        the Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011.

        The Foundations
        Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of
        rebellion,
        extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E.
        teacher
        as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no
        measurable
        upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. However, the
        system
        failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states.
        Consequently,
        in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector at the
        Kharagpur
        railway station to make ends meet.

        Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi.
        Inspired
        by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the more
        financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya,
        where
        his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers
        in
        alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in
        November
        2004.

        By then a broad 22-year-old with long locks, Dhoni’s India career got off to an inauspicious start, as he scored
        a duck
        in his first ODI and a string of low scores followed. However, the selectors and the then-captain Sourav Ganguly
        decided
        to persist with him and gave him an extended run. Dhoni repaid their faith with an exhibition of his charisma
        and
        audacious stroke-play in his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who certainly didn’t see the butchery coming, as he
        butchered
        his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he went one step further bludgeoning his way to a brutal 183*
        in Jaipur
        to make a mockery of a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan attack that looked aghast at his bizarre-but-effective
        stroke-play and the unparalleled physical power that he imparted on the ball.</p>
