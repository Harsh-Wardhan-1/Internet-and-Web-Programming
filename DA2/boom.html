        Having been a consistent performer in the domestic circuit, Bumrah has been a menace to the batsmen at the Ranji
        level
        since his debut. His quick-arm action has made his variations almost indiscernible - starting from his slower
        deliveries
        to his reverse-swinging yorkers at the death. An injury kept him out of action for a while in the 2014/15
        seasons but he
        returned and continued to perform unaffected by the injury break. A national call-up seemed to be just around
        the
        corner.

        The inevitable call came at last as Bumrah travelled with the Indian team to Australia as an injury-replacement
        for
        Mohammad Shami, eventually making his debut in the dead rubber at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He has delivered
        consistent
        performances in coloured clothing and has since become an irreplaceable asset for his captain, consistently
        holding his
        nerve and becoming MS Dhoni's bowling counterpart as a last-over specialist for India. He went on to perform
        commendably
        for a young fast bowler in India's next world events - the ICC Champions' Trophy in 2017, where he only took 4
        wickets
        in 5 matches, but conceded at an economy rate of just 5 runs an over, particularly impressive for a death overs'
        specialist.

        Only one question remained. Can Bumrah become an effective Test bowler? He has shown appetite and ability for
        red-ball
        cricket, bowling Gujarat to their maiden Ranji Trophy title, in 2016-17. However, the Kookaburra ball posed a
        whole new
        challenge. He was handed the elusive Test cap in January 2018 in South Africa, and showed his adaptability with
        his
        skiddy nippers and unpredictable scrambled-seamers, proving to be the find of the tour for India - in other
        words, a
        good start in Tests for the versatile Bumrah.

        In the season to follow, Bumrah's reputation would grow staggeringly as he would take Test cricket by storm in
        just his
        first year in whites. With sensational performances in England and Australia, he broke the record for the most
        wickets
        taken in overseas Tests by an Indian bowler in a single year.</p>
